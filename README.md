# The-Swamp-Blog
A blog to keep track of the highs and lows of the greatest swamp in the mortal realms.

## Goals
- Pure clean text based
- Fast loads times
- 90's asthetic
- Pages written in HTML

# Info
The website is connect to a mongo database for simple blob text storage (I just like the mongo ui is easy to use). The backend will be written in rust for safe and minimal control, this repository will hold the uncompiled rust so I can recompile on whatever syste I need). All pages written in plain html (maybe some javascript for specific things)
